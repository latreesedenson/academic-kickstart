From June 5th to June 18th, 2016, I participated in a larval ecology research cruise in the Caribbean with the NOAA FORCES lab. From day to day they blogged about different activities taking place on the ship. On a few days they featured various scientists that were participating in the cruise. [Here](http://nfchroniclesnoaa.blogspot.com/2016/06/featured-scientists-latreese-denson-and.html) is the blog entry featuring moi. Donâ€™t forget to also catch up on my personal blog that I worked on during the cruise.

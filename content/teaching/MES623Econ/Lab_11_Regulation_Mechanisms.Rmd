In today's lab, we explore pollution regulations in terms of caps and taxes, under the equimarginal principle.

If we can recall from lecture (lecture 8), the **equimarginal principle** states that the costs of pollution control are minimized when the marginal costs of abatement are equalized across sources.

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.cap = "Equimarginal Principle"}
knitr::include_graphics('/images/MES623_Lab11_EP_picture.png')
```

Given the graphic we have two sources of pollution, the optimal price per additional unit of abatement is the same for each source. The optimal level of abatement is different for each source at that price.


**For 3 different sources of pollution, we are given information on levels of abatement, and their marginal Cost.** Download the data [here](/files/MES623_Lab11_lab_data.csv).

Let's read in the data:
```{r}
Data = read.csv("MES623_Lab11_lab_data.csv")
```

### Creating Marginal Cost Functions
Now, let's determine a model/functional form for the marginal cost of abatement for each of the different sources. First, look at your data in a plot:
```{r}
#Source A
plot(Data$Abatement, Data$MC_A, pch = 16, cex = 1.3, col = "blue",
          main = "Marginal cost of abatement of Source A",
     xlab = "Abatement", ylab = "Marginal cost") 
```
It looks like a straight line should work so our functional form, where the intercept can be estimated by R. Our model should look like something like this: $$Y=\alpha+\beta X$$, where $X$ is the level of abatement. Let's try this in a basic linear model.
```{r}
# Model for Source A
Model_A <- lm(Data$MC_A~Data$Abatement)
summary(Model_A)

# Original Plot of Source A data (run these lines all at one time)
plot(Data$Abatement, Data$MC_A, pch = 16, cex = 1.3, col = "blue",
      main = "Marginal cost of abatement of Sector A",
     xlab = "Abatement", ylab = "Marginal cost")
lines(Data$Abatement,predict(Model_A)) # Plot the predicted Marginal cost given the model
```

Another way to check to see if this model works is by checking the r.squared values. Remember our definitions from lab 8: 

**R-squared** - A measure of the linear relationship between the $X$ and the $Y$ variables. Stays between 0 and 1: 0 - the model does not explain the variance in the response variable; 1 - the model explains the variance in the response variable.

```{r}
summary(Model_A)$r.squared
summary(Model_A)$adj.r.squared
```
Our results show that 65.5 % of the variance is being explained by our model. This is greater than 50% so we should be OK to use this as our functional form. But let's try forcing the intercept to be zero and see if we get a better R-squared values.
```{r}
Model_A <- lm(Data$MC_A~0+Data$Abatement)
summary(Model_A)$r.squared
summary(Model_A)$adj.r.squared
```
This improved our values so we will use the newer model as our functional form.

Let's try this same functional form for Source B:
```{r}
# Source B
Model_B <- lm(Data$MC_B~0+Data$Abatement)
summary(Model_B)$r.squared
summary(Model_B)$adj.r.squared
```
Our R squared is pretty OK. Let's take a look at the plot of the observed and predicted data.

```{r}
plot(Data$Abatement, Data$MC_B, pch = 16, cex = 1.3, col = "blue", 
      main = "Marginal cost of abatement of Source B",
     xlab = "Abatement", ylab = "Marginal cost")
lines(Data$Abatement,predict(Model_B))
```
Looks good to me!

Let's do the same thing for our last source of pollution, source c.
```{r}
Model_C<- lm(Data$MC_C~0+Data$Abatement)
summary(Model_C)$r.squared
summary(Model_C)$adj.r.squared

plot(Data$Abatement, Data$MC_C, pch = 16, cex = 1.3, col = "blue", main = "Marginal cost of abatement of Source C", 
     xlab = "Abatement", ylab = "Marginal cost")
lines(Data$Abatement,predict(Model_C))
```

This is OK, but it looks like there are a good proportion of the points in the middle abatement range that are below the line. Maybe we need a curved line? To do this we can make the relationship with abatement quadratic rather than linear. In the code below we use the I() operator around the squared abatement term to tell R that this is a part of the linear regression not a separate operation in the formula. Try running the linear model without `I()` and see what you get.
```{r}
Model_C <- lm(Data$MC_C~0+Data$Abatement+I(Data$Abatement^2))
summary(Model_C)$r.squared
summary(Model_C)$adj.r.squared

plot(Data$Abatement, Data$MC_C, pch = 16, cex = 1.3, col = "blue", 
       main = "Marginal cost of abatement of source C", 
     xlab = "Abatement", ylab = "Marginal cost")
lines(Data$Abatement,predict(Model_C))
```
Our R-squared values went up and the graph doesn't look too bad!

We now have three models for marginal cost, two are linear and one is quadratic. As in previous labs we can extract the coefficients from each model using R code similar to `Model_C$coefficients[1]`.

### Creating Demand Curves
Let's deal with the linear models first. The marginal cost of abatement from source $i$ is given by $MC_i=a_i+b_iA_i$, where $a_i$ and $b_i$ are the intercept and the slope estimated in the regression analysis, respectively. In our case the intercept is forced to be zero. When the current level of emissions is $A^0_i$, then the demand for carbon emissions is given by $P_i=(a_i+b_iA^0_i)-b_iQ_i$; where $Q_i$ is an amount of carbon in tons. Let's say the current levels of emissions for source A and B are 160 and 220 respectively.To get a full demand curve we want to calculate the demand for each $Q$ between zero and the current level of emissions.

```{r}
# Our current level of emissions saved as an object
Qt_A = 220
Qt_B = 160

# Demand for source A
# Remember we don't have an intercept, just a coefficient for abatement.
# This means the alpha term from the equation above goes away.
D_A = (Model_A$coefficients[1]*Qt_A)-Model_A$coefficients[1]*seq(0,Qt_A,1) 
# seq() generating a sequence of Qs for this calculation

# Demand for source B
D_B = (Model_B$coefficients[1]*Qt_B)-Model_B$coefficients[1]*seq(0,Qt_B,1)
```

Now, source C is similar but with the quadratic model. If the marginal cost is given by $MC_i=a_i+b_iA_i+c_iA^2_i$, the demand curve is given by $P_i=b_i(A^0_i-Q_i)+c_i(A^0_i-Q_i)^2$ where the intercept is zero. Again, the current level of emissions is $A^0_i$ which is 400 for source C.
```{r}
# Our current level of emissions saved as an object
Qt_C = 240

D_C <- Model_C$coefficients[1]*(Qt_C-seq(0,Qt_C,1))+Model_C$coefficients[2]*(Qt_C-seq(0,Qt_C,1))^2
```

Let's graph these demand curves. Which pollution source is willing to pay the most for the first unit of carbon emissions?
```{r}
plot(c(0,300),c(0,300), type="n", xlab="Emissions", ylab="Price", main="Demand for Emissions")
lines(seq(0,Qt_A,1),D_A,lwd=2)
lines(seq(0,Qt_B,1),D_B,col="red",lwd=2)
lines(seq(0,Qt_C,1),D_C,col="green",lwd=2)
legend("topright",legend=c("Source A","Source B","Source C"),
        col=c("black","red","green"), lty=c(1,1,1), cex=0.8)

```
It seems that Source C (green) is the one willing to pay the most of for the first unit of emission.

### Abatement Regulation: A Cap
Pollution sources A and C are the pollution sources for country Z, and their regulation states that there must be a cap on carbon emissons. They must cut their emissions by a fourth of their current emissions (reducing total emissions from 460 to 345). There will be no local pollutants affected by the carbon abatement so we do not have to worry about co-benefits. What is the total cost of following this regulation, as well as the cost of abatement and pollution for each source?

First, we have to remember that to get from marginal values to totals, we need to calculate the area below the marginal curve. We typically just take the area of a triangle below the curve but we can do this another way. We can calculate an integral, where the area below a straight line, $y=a+bx$, between two arbitrary points, $x_0$ and $x_1$, is given by:

$$\int_{x_0}^{x_1}a+bx\;dx=ax+\frac{b}{2}x^2+C\;\Bigg\vert^{x_1}_{x_0}=a(x_1-x_0)+\frac{b}{2}(x_1^2-x_0^2)$$
If you don't remember integrals it's OK. Just remember that if you are taking an integral with respects to a certain variable such as $X$, you just increase the power of the variable and divide by that power. For instance, the integral of the constant $a$ is $ax$. We added an $X^1/1$ to our constant giving us $ax$. We do this for each term in the equation and then evaluate the equation at $x_1$ and subtract the same equation evaluated at $x_0$.

For the quadratic marginal cost function, $y=bx+cx^2$, we do the same thing:

$$\int_{x_0}^{x_1}bx+cx^2\;dx=\frac{b}{2}x^2+\frac{c}{3}x^3+C\;\Bigg\vert^{x_1}_{x_0}=\frac{b}{2}(x_1^2-x_0^2)+\frac{c}{3}(x_1^3-x_0^3)$$

Given our new equations for area we can estimate the total cost of abating a fourth of their units in each sector, where $x_0=0$ and $x_1=Q_t/4$ where Qt changes based on the pollution source. Let's create some functions to do this for us.

```{r}
linear.cost <- function(x0,x1,b) 
  # the function will take the values for the units of abatement and the coefficient
  # remember there is only one coefficient since we forced the intercept to be zero
  # you may need two coefficients for your homework
  {
  as.numeric(b/2*(x1^2-x0^2)) # here is the equation for the integral of the linear function
  }

quadratic.cost <- function(x0,x1,b,c) # same as the linear function
  { 
  as.numeric(b/2*(x1^2-x0^2)+c/3*(x1^3-x0^3)) # the integral of the quadratic function
  }

# Total cost for Source A
C4_A <- linear.cost(0,(Qt_A/4),Model_A$coefficients[1])
C4_A

# Total cost for Source C
C4_C <- quadratic.cost(0,(Qt_C/4),Model_C$coefficients[1],Model_C$coefficients[2])
C4_C

# Total cost
C4_A+C4_C
```

### Abatement Regulation: Tax
To emit a ton of carbon in country Z, you must pay a tax of $t$ per unit of carbon emitted. Again let's find the total cost of abatement and the cost of abatement and pollution for each source of pollution. 

First we will need to find the minimum tax that allows us to reduce total emissions by 1/4 (from 460 to 345). Does this sound familiar? 

Yes, we must invoke the equimarginal principle! We need to find the optimal allocation of units that minimizes the total cost of abating 115 units. Basically, all sources will abate until their marginal cost of abatement is equal, and the total abatement is 115.

We need an optimization function that minimizes total cost by adjusting the number of units abated between source A and C. The units abated between sources have to add to 115 but can be distributed across sources in many ways. We will use the library `Rsolnp` for this.

```{r}
# Load the optimizing library
library(Rsolnp)
```

Let's think about how we will set up our optimization. Recall the previous labs. Here is the format:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
OO <- solnp( X,# Starting values
      fun =  # Function to minimize
      eqfun = # Total abatement achieved
      eqB = # Total abatement goal
      LB =  # Lower bound for decision variables, must be a vector 
      UB = # Upper bound for decision variables, must be a vector as well)
```

Let's start filling things in.
```{r}
# Total cost funtion to be minimized
tot.cost = function(X){ # X is a vector of two abatement values, one for source A and one for source C
  
  # Total cost for Source A
  Cost_A = linear.cost(0,X[1],Model_A$coefficients[1]) # X[1] is the units of abatement for source A
 
   # Total cost for source C
  Cost_C = quadratic.cost(0,X[2],Model_C$coefficients[1],Model_C$coefficients[2])
  
  # Total cost
  TC <- Cost_A+Cost_C
  TC
}

# The total abatement has to be 1/4 of the total which is 115
# Function that calculates total abatement
tot.abatement <- function(X)
  { 
  TA <- sum(X) # Sum of the vector of values of abatement
  TA
}

X <- rep(0.1,2) # Create a set of starting values different than zero.

OO <- solnp(X, # Starting values
      fun = tot.cost, # Function to minimize
      eqfun = tot.abatement, # Total abatement achieved
      eqB = 115, # Total abatement goal
      LB = rep(0,2), # Lower bound for decision variables, must be a vector 
      UB = c(Qt_A,Qt_C)) # Upper bound for decision variables, must be a vector as well

X <- OO$pars # extract the level of abatement at the optimal price for both sources
X
```
Notice the two values in the X vector sum to 115, so that part worked.

Given the equimarginal principle, the optimal tax is equal to the marginal cost of abatement at equilibrium. If the theory is right, that means that at the optimal solution, all marginal costs of abatement should be the same. Let's check that prediction:

```{r}
# Source A
opt.MC_A= Model_A$coefficients[1]*X[1]
opt.MC_A

# Source C
opt.MC_C=Model_C$coefficients[1]*X[2]+Model_C$coefficients[2]*X[2]^2
opt.MC_C
```

It worked! The optimal tax is $t^*=35.31$.

What was the total cost of abatement? We can use our `tot.cost` function to figure this out. It has the integral within it.
```{r}
tot.cost(X)
```

What is the cost of abatement for each source? Use the individual integral functions.
```{r}
# Cost of abating for Source A
as.numeric(linear.cost(0,X[1],Model_A$coefficients[1]))

# Cost of abating for Source C
as.numeric(quadratic.cost(0,X[2],Model_C$coefficients[1],Model_C$coefficients[2]))
```

What is the cost of pollution for each source? Units of carbon emission that are above the optimal units of abatement are taxed.
```{r}
tax = opt.MC_C 
# Cost of polluting for source A
# any units from the point of abatement to the current emissions level, are taxed
as.numeric((Qt_A-X[1])*tax) 
# Cost of polluting for Source C
as.numeric((Qt_C-X[2])*tax)
```


### Abatement Regulation: Cap and Trade
We will pick up here next week. What would the total cost be if we not only had a cap of 1/4 of total emissions but the two sources were also allowed to trade?
